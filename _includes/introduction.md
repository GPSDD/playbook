If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?  If a dataset is released to the world and no one is able to access it, does it have value?  Open data is more than just releasing 1s and 0s.  Building access, writing documentation, ensuring standards, and other features are required for meaningful use.

The **objecive of this Playbook** is to guide local developers through the process of building web services that can be seamlessly integrated by the global developer community.  The Global Partnership has identified 12 key "plays" drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help developers build better digital services in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Many of these plays (and even the format of this Playbook) are forked directly from our friends at the [United States Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov) Playbook.
