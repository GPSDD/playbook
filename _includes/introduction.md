<!-- ## The Data Playbook -->

The global community has adopted 17 Goals to improve the lives of everyone on Earth.  These Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include eliminating extreme poverty and protecting our natural environment.  We need data to monitor and evaluate progress toward these goals.  We can't expect to reach the goals blindly.  

The Global Partnership has created a playbook of 13 key "plays" drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help the global community of SDG developers build effective digital services.  Many of these goals (and even the format of this playbook) is forked directly from our friends at the United States Digital Service playbook.
