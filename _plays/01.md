title: Document everything
---

The objective of building access for Document both the input *and* the output of the web service.  


### Checklist
1. List and briefly describe each field in the returned object, whether it is JSON, GeoJSON, XML, etc.
2. Provide a sample query with sample output.
3. Clearly highlight required versus optional arguments.
4. Describe the response statuses.
5. Consider existing projects that help generate documentation, like [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), [ApiDocJS](http://apidocjs.com/), [SpringRestDoc](https://bitbucket.org/tritales/springrestdoc/overview), [RAML](http://raml.org/), or any of dozens of projects specifically built to document web services.

### Key Questions
- Would you be able to meaningfully and quickly use the service if you revisited it one year from now?
- Is there a standard data format for the subgroup that would most actively use the service?
- Does your documentation or developer page require a custom solution, or can you rely on existing documentation projects?
- If your mom were a halfway decent developer, would she be able to understand the documentation?  Is it accessible to a reasonably broad audience?
